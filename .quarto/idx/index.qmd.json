The content will be for a broad audience including those interested in ML but without practical experience.*\n\n#### Details:\n\nEvent will be at 7pm at the Easy Expense offices on 2nd ave.\n\n\n#### Tickets\nMake sure to get your (free) ticket at the [eventbrite page here](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/machine-learning-for-salmonids-conservation-tickets-1979951371852?aff=oddtdtcreator), so we know how many people to expect. \n\n# [Check out our past events](past-events/past-events.qmd)\n\n# And join our Slack channel. \nShoot us an email to get an invite.\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","files":{"exclude":["**/*.ipynb"]},"theme":"materia","title":"Welcome to our landing page"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
