This was a fascinating talk on quantum physics, quantum computing and some applications of machine learning within all of this. 

The talk was really well attended - by over 20 people, from a wide range of backgrounds. 

The Q&A afterwards was great fun, and went on a lot longer than scheduled. Thanks so much Eric for this fun evening.
