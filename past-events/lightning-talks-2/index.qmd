# We hosted a lightning talks session. 
The goal was to see what technologies people in the community had been working with since our last meetup. 



### Marimo

Elliot had recently attended a conference, during which he learned about [Marimo](https://marimo.io/features/vs-jupyter-alternative), a [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) alternative which runs pure python under the hood, making live updates to the entire notebook rather than the usual cell by cell execution we're used to when working with notebooks. 

### FastHTML

Mike had been working on a web app using [FastHTML](https://fastht.ml/) - a python interface for building websites. It uses HTMX under the hood, and abstracts away all the HTML, CSS and JavaScript normally needed when building interactive websites. He gave a demo of a riddle generating app, which prompted the user with an LLM generated riddle, and berated the user in a Monty Python-esque manner for incorrect answers.
