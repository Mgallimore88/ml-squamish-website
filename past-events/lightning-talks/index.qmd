# We hosted our first lightning talks session. 
The goal was to provid a space for people to present a problem they're working on, and get input and ideas from the community. 

We were kindly hosted by The Squamish Welcome Centre


We had 9 people in attendance. Some highlights:

- Jacqui got some help setting up a python programming environment on her laptop.

- Elliot presented his new project which searches conference videos in a youtube like interface, allowing effective searching of technical conference videos such as PyCon.

- David got some advice on running his first focus group - in particular from Christy who had prior experience in this area. The aim of the focus group was to gain insight for his parkinsons communication aid project, which he later presented at one of our meetups.  

- Mike was troubleshooting part of the data processing for his birdsong recognition project. 



The event went really smoothly. Everybody learned something new, and got a chance to get help from the community. 


After the lightning talks, we all went to the Copper Coil for a social.
