    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### GPU vs. CPU <br>\n",
    "- CPUs process information in series, and are very powerful. GPUs divide tasks across multiple processing units, and process them in parallel.\n",
    "- On a GPU, each processing unit is less powerful than a single processing unit of a typical CPU. \n",
    "- Some operations such as displaying pixels on a screen can run faster on a GPU if they are easily divided into a parallel process. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/A100.jpg' width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why do we need a GPU to run deep learning models? <br>\n",
    "(Short answer: You don't! but it's much faster because of parallel processing on a GPU)<br>\n",
    "- Deep learning models are built using neural networks. Training of a neural network involves calculating parameters and activations at each node of the network. Since each of these operations is fairly small, they're self similar,and there are many of them, it is more efficient to run these operations in parallel on the GPU. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why process information on the cloud vs on local machine?\n",
    "- Your machine may or may not have a GPU. \n",
    "- If you do have a GPU, it is likely that the free GPUs offered by cloud computing platforms are more powerful.\n",
    "- Deep learning can require large amounts of data, and transferring this data across internet connections and storing locally can be problematic. \n",
    "- Cloud computing lets you get set up and running code more quickly. Personal computers with Linux, windows and Mac would all have different install requirements, which takes a while to work through. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/gpus.png' width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why paperspace gradient?\n",
    "- There are other options including Google Colab, Kagggle, and running locally on your machine. This is just one option. One of the advantages of Gradient is that it lets you run jupyter notebooks in their native form, whereas other platforms modify the user interface a little.\n",
