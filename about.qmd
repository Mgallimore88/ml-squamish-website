We are a group of Squamish residents connected over a common interest in machine learning, data science and AI. 

We aim to grow skills and knowledge, and make connections through a series of talks, group coding events, pair programming and hackathons.

To get involved, come along on Wednesday evenings to meet the group!

You can shoot us an email here: [mlsquamish@gmail.com](mlsquamish@gmail.com)

We host our meets at [The Common](http://thecommon.io) - a community workspace on Cleveland. Check out their website and definitely give them a try if you have a remote job and want an office space.
