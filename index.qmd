Join us for an exciting in-person meetup on machine learning! Whether you're a newbie or an expert, this event is perfect for anyone interested in this fascinating field. We'll gather at 1909 Maple Dr, Squamish, BC V8B 0T1, Canada to discuss and share our knowledge about machine learning algorithms, data analysis, and more.

The rundown:

Peter will give a short talk on Tranformers - the transformative neural architecture behind ChatGPT, freaky-image-generators, and a bunch of other things.
