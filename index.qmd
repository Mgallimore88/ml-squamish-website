#### Abstract:

*The rapid development of ML tools has great potential to aid biodiversity monitoring and nature conservation.*

*Over the last years Thor has been involved in developing a set of tools for trout and salmon conservation, ranging from counting different species of salmon in underwater video imagery to recognizing individual trout based on their spot patterns.*

*Thor will describe the technical approaches we use embedded in a biological context as the tools are only truly useful if they solve real-world problems and improve the current approaches used. The content will be for a broad audience including those interested in ML but without practical experience.*

#### Details:

Event will be at 7pm at the Easy Expense offices on 2nd ave.
